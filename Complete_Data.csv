On Ninoy Aquino ‚Äòselling‚Äô Sabah
> This claim is unproven. Hermes Dorado, former national territory division head of the Department of Foreign Affairs, claimed in 2013 that Aquino met with then-Malaysian Prime Minister Mohammad Mahathir.
On Cory Aquino ‚Äòselling‚Äô the Philippine Airlines
> This needs context. Philippine Airlines (PAL) was privatized in March 1992, towards the end of Aquino‚Äôs term as president, although plans to sell the company were made years earlier. 
On Noynoy Aquino selling the Scarborough Shoal
> This is false. In 2012, the former president said former senator Antonio Trillanes IV was approached by Chinese officials to do backchannel negotiations with China in order to resolve tensions over Scarborough Shoal at the time.

Aquino was not present at the event as he was allegedly at a birthday party with Sen. Doy Laurel and his family in a nearby restaurant. But there‚Äôs no concrete evidence proving that his absence meant he was among those who planned the violent attack.
Until now, without any substantial basis, claims that Aquino was one of the plotters are merely unfounded rumors and not a historical fact. He was never linked to any concrete evidence or definite report or tagged by a witness.

Although some books do emphasize the narrative surrounding Ninoy Aquino and his family during the Martial Law period and post-EDSA, much of the literature cited also sheds light on the atrocities of the Marcos dictatorship, the majority of which were unseen and/or repressed during the height of Martial Law in the country. One of the books included, Robles‚Äô Marcos Martial Law: Never Again (2016), contains official records, reports, eyewitness accounts, and interviews with survivors and military officers that give credence to the regime‚Äôs abuses.

Aquino, in a televised interview while in prison in March 1978, denied being a CIA agent. He, however, admitted that he had sometimes exchanged information with the agency and once carried out a secret mission to Indonesia during a ‚ÄúCIA-backed rebellion‚Äù there in 1958, as reported by the New York Times. Aquino justified it as part of his duties as a former government official.
While Sison recognized that Aquino was ‚Äúnot known to be hostile to the NPA,‚Äù he said there was ‚Äúno formal alliance‚Äù between them.

Aquino was not present at the event as he was allegedly at a birthday party with Sen. Doy Laurel and his family in a nearby restaurant. But there‚Äôs no concrete evidence proving that his absence meant he was among those who planned the violent attack.

He was never linked to any concrete evidence or definite report or tagged by a witness.
